					1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, also known as <q>Eleanor</q>, is my favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Mustang">Shelby Mustang</a> and my dream car.

					I am into extreme sports and motor racing (partly because I suck at ball games). Among different extreme sports, my favorite is snowbording. Before I get too old, I would to be able to do snowboard trick like my favorite snowborder, Travis Rice.

					Friedrich Nietzsche (German philologist, philosopher, cultural critic, poet and composer) once said <q>Without music, life would be a mistake</q>.
					I think, I cannot live without music. My favorite genre is funk and punk rock.  
					<br>
					<br>
					Did you know that I used to play Bass guitar in a band during in my 20s? Our band mostly played punk rocks (original + several covers) in small gigs.
					Now, it's a bit difficult to spare time and play Bass and, unfortunately, I also had to sell my Bass when I was leaving Paris. 
					But, in 2015, I would like to get a new Bass and play it on my spare time.
